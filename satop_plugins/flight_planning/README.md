# SatOP_plugin_flight_planning
A repository specifically for the SatOP plugin focusing on scheduling of flight plans

## Known Issues
- It is currently not possible to update flightplans once they are created (how this should be done is still under discussion)
- Once a flight plan has been approved or rejected, it cannot be edited (whether this is a wanted feature or not is still under discussion)
